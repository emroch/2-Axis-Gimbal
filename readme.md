#2-Axis Gimbal using Arduino

This was a school project for ECE 110 - Intorduction to Electronics
at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

The project requirement was to choose a sensor to characterize and
build a project using your chosen sensor. My lab partner, Ankur Mehta,
and I chose to make a gimbal using a 3-axis accelerometer and an Arduino
(we actually used a Teensy because it fit on the breadboard better).

For the gimbal itself, we used two small servo motors and a pant/tilt
bracket from Sparkfun.

In the /docs folder of this repository, you will find the following:
- A (Fritzing)[fritzing.org] document containing the physical and
electrical schematics for the project
- 2 PNG images of the breadboard layout and electrical schematic
- The ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer datasheet
- An Excel spreadsheet containing the calibration data we used
